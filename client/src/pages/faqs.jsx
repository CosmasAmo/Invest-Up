Withdraw options will show up: a) Option 1: Send via Crypto Network - This prompts you to paste the wallet address you copied from the website. Note: the network you choose should be similar to the wallet address you copied. b) Send via Email/Phone/ID (0 fee) - Set the mode to Binance ID, paste the Binance ID you copied from our website.
